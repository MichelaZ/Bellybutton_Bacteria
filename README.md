# Bellybutton_Bacteria

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a dashboard where volunteers in a study on bellybutton bacteria could view their results anonymously. The dashboard includes metadata about the subject, a bar chart of the top ten bacteria in their sample, a gauge(I used a modified pie chart, because I preferred the look) showing their wash frequency, and a bubble chart with all the bacteria cultures. {View my website.]( https://michelaz.github.io/Bellybutton_Bacteria/Submission/index.html)

## UX/UI Analysis:
I changed up the layout some. I added a picture and a little text blurb.

I got rid of the jumbotron and opted for a navigation bar. I added some cool CSS formatting and a background image to it.

The colors in the plate staining image inspired the palette for the rest of the site, but maybe I should have picked something else to make it feel more scientific. It was really important to me to have a navigation that scrolled with the page. I don’t like to have to scroll back to the top of the page to navigate between pages or make selections. I added my drop down selection and header to the navigation menu as well as buttons to pages where you can view either the bar or bubble graph separately.

I know having the site viewable in mobile is important, because that is what most users use the internet on so I tried to make the site more responsive, but found that even if I did the plotly plots just didn’t look great. If I could figure that out I would take the time to make the navigation bar more responsive, but I was investing to much time. The buttons work, but the titles and drop down disappear.

One last improvement would be to have the website save your selection in the dropdown when navigating through the different pages.

## Code Analysis:
I think a general improvement would be to add more comments and clean up my code’s organization, but I was having a lot of fun playing around so I didn’t have time. In the other activities on this module I organized the code a little different and made a function for each graph and If I were to refactor the code I would do the same for this project.
